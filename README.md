## 💡 My Development Approach

1. **Frontend Bootstrapping**: Initialized using `create-react-app` and structured components/pages.
2. **Routing**: Set up `React Router` for navigation (login, register, dashboard, blog view, etc).
3. **Blog Editor**: Integrated `CKEditor 5` for rich text editing of blogs.
4. **Authentication**: Stored JWT in localStorage to persist user sessions.
5. **Axios Integration**: Created API calls for login, register, blog CRUD.
6. **Image Uploads**: Enabled image support through multipart/form-data.
7. **Blog View**: Implemented detail view, author info, created date, and sorting logic.
8. **Polishing**: Styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS for responsive design.
